Its residents can boast a palace, lake and horse riding stables virtually in their front garden – and all in Zone 1. Its cultural and social mix, reflected in the amazingly varied restaurants and food stores that line up along Queensway, lends the area some unusual contrasts. Bayswater is cosmopolitan yet comfortable, cutting edge yet cultured. There's a strong sense of community here with a residents’ association and local magazine, and people tend to know their neighbours, a fact helped by the many shared garden squares. Historically famous for London’s first department store Whiteleys, and for having the highest concentration of hotels in London, the Bayswater of today is a much changed place. Many of the hotels are being converted into residential blocks, and there are big plans to develop Whiteleys and inject new life into Queensway.
